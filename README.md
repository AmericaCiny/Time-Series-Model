# ARIMA Models
Developed time series models to identify and analyze patterns within the data, including testing for stationarity. Determined the appropriate AutoRegressive (AR) order 'p', Moving Average (MA) order 'q', or both (ARMA(p, q)) based on the dataset's characteristics. Constructed ARIMA models along with Holt-Winters models, optimizing parameters to accurately forecast COVID-19 case trends.

# Time Series Model
Applied Holt-Winters forecasting to extract level, trend, seasonality and make forecast for future h weeks.
